# Split and order
### Goal: java experience, String manipulation, logical thinking

#### expected time: 15min (+ 5min on version 2)

Knowledge/Intuition about the Java String class is necessary.

### Task: 
Take a given String with comma seperated and reoccurring words and order print them 
ordered by how many times they are contained in the String.

Example:

        3 x cat
        2 x lars
        1 x rose
        1 x circus
        1 x cauliflower
        1 x bit

If a little more is to be expected from the candidate, 
let him also order the output alphabetically. 
This might result in refactoring of the implementation and stretch the time needed a lot.

ðŸ¡’ Decide on the version of this assignment beforehand 
or only adjust it for candidates that rushed through the rest of the task. 

Example:
        
         3 x cat            ðŸ¡’ 3 x cat 
         2 x lars           ðŸ¡’ 2 x lars
         1 x rose           ðŸ¡’ 1 x bit
         1 x circus         ðŸ¡’ 1 x cauliflower
         1 x cauliflower    ðŸ¡’ 1 x circus
         1 x bit            ðŸ¡’ 1 x rose
