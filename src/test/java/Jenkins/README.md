# Jenkins
### Goal: experience with Jenkins, cron and triggers

---
Inside the *Jenkins.groovy* file you will find an empty pipeline.

## Assignement:
1. make the parameter *cfg_result* configurable via a dropdown on the Jenkins UI
2. configure a trigger that triggers the job each day at a specific time of your choosing
3. write an execute step that does nothing more than write the *cfg_result* to the console
